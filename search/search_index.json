Fromont, Arcadi Navarro, Manuel Rueda, Gary Saunders, Babita Singh, J.Dylan Spalding, Juha Tornroos,  Claudia Vasallo, Colin D.Veal, Anthony J.Brookes.  Human Mutation (2022) DOI.</p> Is it <code>Beacon</code> or <code>beacon</code>? <p>The uppercase <code>Beacon</code> is used to label API, framework or protocol and their components - while lower case <code>beacons</code> are instances of these, i.e. individual resources using the protocol.</p> How do I emulate Beacon v1 while supporting the v2 protocol? <p>The Beacon Framework describes the overall structure of the API requests, responses, parameters etc. One can implement e.g. a Boolean beacon (cf. the original protocol) without any use of the model, just by providing a well-formed JSON response upon a request very similar to the (pre-)v1 allele request.</p> What are the general security principles for Beacon? <p>An implementation of a Beacon must implement the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Beacon standard. The V2 standard has been approved by both the Regulatory and Ethics, and Data Security foundational workstreams.</p> <p>The Beacon uses a 3-tiered access model - anonymous, registered, and controlled access:</p> <ul> <li>A Beacon that supports anonymous access responds to queries irrespective of the source of the query.</li> <li>For a Beacon to respond to a query at the registered tier, the user must identify themselves to the Beacon, for example by using an ELIXIR identity.</li> <li>For a Beacon to respond to a controlled access query, the user must have applied for, and been granted access to, the Beacon (or data derived from one or more individuals within the Beacon) before sending the query. </li> </ul> <p>Note that a Beacon may contain datasets (or collections of individuals) whose data is only accessible at specified tiers within the Beacon. This tiered access model allows the owner or controller of a Beacon to determine which responses are returned to whom depending on the query and the user who is making the request, for example to ensure the response respects the consent under which the data were collected. The ELIXIR Beacon network supports Beacons which respond at different tiers, for example only Beacons which have a response to anonymous queries need respond to an anonymous request. </p> <p>As part of the ELIXIR 2019-21 Beacon Network Implementation Study deliverable D3.3 a document has been written to describe security best practice for users interested in deploying or running a Beacon or users who govern data hosted within a Beacon, and the requirements for adding the Beacon to the ELIXIR Beacon network. As the Beacon standard extends in V2 towards supporting phenotype and range queries, the tiered access model becomes more important to ensure the Beacon response is appropriate to the underlying data.</p> How is security actually implemented when I deploy a Beacon? <p>Security attributes are part of the Beacon v2 Framework. The file <code>beaconConfiguration.json</code> defines the schema of the JSON file that includes core aspects of a Beacon instance configuration. Its third section, called securityAttributes, defines the security.</p> <p>Check out the securityAttributes section on the Beacon Documentation website.</p> How do I test a Beacon without having to go through complex security matters (yet)? <p>As a Beacon is designed to support data discoverability of controlled access datasets, it is recommended that synthetic or artificial data is used for testing and initial deployment of Beacon instances. The use of synthetic data for testing is important in that it ensures that the full functionality of a Beacon can be tested and / or demonstrated without risk of exposing data from individuals. In addition to testing or demonstrating a deployment, synthetic data should be used for development, for example adding new features. Additionally, these data can also be used to demonstrate the access levels and data governance procedures for loading data to a Beacon to build trust with data controllers or data access committees who may be considering loading data to a Beacon. An example dataset that contains chromosome specific vcf files is hosted at EGA under dataset accession EGAD00001006673. While this dataset requires a user to log in to get access, the EGA test user can access this dataset.</p> What types of genomic variants are supported in Beacon queries? <p>Beacon v2.0 does not provide a mechanism to detect what types of genomic variant queries are supported by a given instance.</p> <p>Beacon had been originally designed to handle the \"simplest\" type of genomic variant queries in which a <code>position</code>, <code>alternateBases</code> (i.e. one or more base sequence of the variant at the position) and - sometimes optional - the reference sequence at this position (necessary e.g. for small deletions).</p> <p>Beacon v1.1 in principle supported \"bracketed\" queries and a <code>variantType</code> parameter (pointing to the VCF use) - see the current documentation for details. However, the support &amp; interpretation was - and still is (2022-12-13) - left to implementers. Similar for Beacon Range Queries.</p> <p>However, the Beacon documentation provides information about use and expected interpretation of <code>variantType</code> values, specifically for copy number variations.</p> How can I add e.g. an age limit to a query for a disease? <p>Ages are queried as ISO8601 durations such as <code>P65Y</code> (i.e. 65 years) with a comparator (<code>=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> ...). However, the value needs an indication of what the duration refers to and resources may provide different ways to indicate this (as then shown in their <code>/filtering_terms</code>) endpoint).</p> <p>We recommend that all Beacon instances that support age queries support at minimum the syntax of <code>age:&lt;=P65Y</code> and map such values to the internal datapoint most relevant for the resource's context (in most cases probably corresponding to \"age at diagniosis\").</p> <p>However, different scenarios may be supported (e.g. <code>EFO_0005056:&lt;=P1Y6M</code> for an \"age at death\" scenario).</p> How can I handle haplotype queries &amp; representation in Beacon v2? Does the Beacon protocol support Boolean expressions? <p>No (...but). Beacon queries as of v2 always assume a logical AND between query parameters and individual filters, i.e. all conditions have to be met. There is currently no support for Boolean expressions. However, a logical exception is the use of multiple filters for the same parameter which a Beacon implementation should treat as a logical OR since they otherwise would fail in most instances. E.g. the query using <code>NCIT:C3493</code> and <code>NCIT:C2926</code> (mapped against <code>biosample.histological_diagnosis.id</code>) would match both Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma (NCIT:C2926) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (NCIT:C3493) which are exclusive diagnoses. </p> Filters: ... how to respond if the filter hasn't been implemented? <p>A filter which does not exist should lead to \"no match\" response. There is no dedicated mechanism to disambiguate between a \"the filter is understood but there is no hit for this particular query\" in contrast to \"no idea what this filter value means\". However, the <code>/filtering_terms</code> endpoint should provide all supported filters and this can be used to check the two possibilities if needed.</p> Filters: ... how to respond if the filter target has incomplete values? <p>For sparse data (e.g. a value being available only for a subset of samples; think about \"genetic sex\" not being available or disclosed in a subset of individuals) normally only the positive matches would be returned. Evaluation if what the base of these numbers would be can be achieved through discretionary queries (i.e. evaluating the alternative options) or through additional informational responses (e.g. adding the overall observation count of a filter value to the objects in the <code>/filtering_terms</code> response or aggregate information to a dataset respone).</p>"},{"location":"FAQ/#last-change-2023-03-13-by-michael-baudis","title":"last change 2023-03-13 by Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"FAQ/#minimal-example-request","title":"Minimal Example Request","text":"<p>This example is for a minimal SNV-type variant query.</p> <pre><code>/beacon/g_variants/?referenceName=refseq:NC_000017.11&amp;start=7577120&amp;referenceBases=G&amp;alternateBases=A\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"FAQ/#example-boolean-response","title":"Example Boolean Response","text":"<p>In this minimal response to the query above the beacon indicates that its default response is Boolean and that it could interpreted it against the <code>genomicVariant</code> entity and in the context of the same Beacon version.</p> <p>In principle one could launch a Beacon instance using the example response document as a template in whatever server environment one has at hand.

Implementations of the current Beacon API enable the  search for structural variants (e.g. deletions and duplications) and return  richer responses (e.g. variant metadata and call counts).</p> <p>With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon  protocol into resources and workflows, the next major release 2.0 will introduce  new features which were considered important by the community:  Queries by type: The Beacon will define different sets of attributes for  requests and responses depending on the type of query; e.g. a specific request  and response to return variants within a region in a chromosome  (wildcard/region queries) or to get a list of samples related to a phenotype,  provided the required authentication or authorization (see Access levels below). Filters: The next major version of Beacon will include a feature to filter the  matched variants by additional conditions on e.g. sample specific or technical information (e.g., associated phenotypes, assay type). Here the utilisation of ontologies will be encouraged, with alternative use of custom vocabularies for local applications. Schema versions: Given that new query types will return differing responses  (e.g., variant annotations, pointers to data delivery protocols), a mechanism will be implemented to reference internal or external data schemas that describe the content of the Beacon response (e.g., returning variant information using \u201cGA4GH Variant Representation v1\u201d). Access levels: Beacon administrators will be able to specify the level of access  (public, registered or controlled) for each field in the Beacon response and  even refine this definition by dataset, if these diverge from the default  values. This is applicable also to the query types supported (genomic variants, sample lists, etc...)</p>"},{"location":"news/2019-10-21-beaconv2-ga4ghplenary/#author-list","title":"Author List:","text":"<ul> <li>Sabela de la Torre.

An essential part of the strategy concerns the federated access to clinical and reference CNV datasets, e.g. through the implementation of innovative data APIs.</p> <p>The GA4GH Beacon API allows any resource to share the presence or the absence of a particular variation, including since its v0.4 release in 2018 - the support for CNVs.

The implementation should support all features of the latest protocol version and provide rich responses (differential observation frequencies, variant &amp; phenotype information in responses or through handover protocols). Additionally, we shall link this Beacon to the ELIXIR Beacon Network, and enable data sharing via at least one of the three levels of access (public, registered, or controlled), which are enabled via ELIXIR AAI.

This problem needs even more attention since  genomics data sees an ever greater application in clinical settings, such as for medical diagnostic or prognostic purposes,  in rare diseases or cancer. Currently, most of the molecular analyses  generated in hospitals are not utilised for further research due to lack of proper tools for an interoperable and ethical sharing of the data. The Beacon project (ELIXIR, see also the Global Alliance in Health and Genomics for the standard) aims to alleviate the problem of genomics data sharing through enabling the search of genomic variants and associated information without jeopardising the privacy of the dataset. This way, any hospital or research entity can choose to 'beaconize' their dataset without compromising its privacy or ownership.</p> <p>With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon protocol into resources and workflows, the release 2.0 introduces new features considered important by the community: e.g. queries by entity type, filters, schema versions, and access levels. While both the research and the clinical community recognizes the value of these additions, practical implementation of the Beacon could still be a challenging task, especially for institutions with limited IT resources. The ELIXIR implementation studies (2019-2021; 2022-2024) aim to develop a reference implementation so researchers and clinicians can use it as an example to deploy their own Beacon without needing extensive knowledge on how to build an API.</p> <p>This workshop has two objectives, to provide participants with:</p> <p>1-  Demos and insights on Beacon implementations. For this objective we will invite early Beacon v2 implementers who provided valuable feedback to the specification and will share their use-cases and experiences: Michael Baudis (Progenetix), Tim Beck (Caf\u00e9 Variome), and Carles Hernandez (CNAG-CRG). </p> <p>2- A training session on how to d eploy a Beacon using the reference implementation. For this objective we will invite members of the European Genome-phenome Archive (Manuel Rueda) who support Beacon deployment in hospitals and clinical institutions and will provide a hands-on session. </p> <p>Beacon version 2 is a highly expected product in the genomics research and clinical communities.

In the two years since the project\u2019s inception, over 90 Beacons have been lit by 35 organizations serving over 200 datasets. These datasets are searchable individually or in aggregate via the Beacon Network (beacon-network.org), a federated search engine across the world\u2019s public beacons. Beacons serve large, diverse, valuable collections of genomics datasets, showing the viability of a global federated model for genomics data discovery and sharing through a simple and securable technical protocol.

To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles.

LINK | PMID:35705716","text":"<p>Abstract Despite great strides made in the development and wide acceptance of standards for exchanging structured information about genomic variants, progress in standards for computational phenotype analysis for translational genomics has lagged behind. Phenotypic features (signs, symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, results of physiological tests, etc.) are of high clinical importance, yet exchanging them in conjunction with genomic variation information is often overlooked or even neglected. In the clinical domain, substantial work has been dedicated to the development of computational phenotypes. Traditionally, these approaches have largely relied on rule-based methods and large sources of clinical data to identify cohorts of patients with or without a specific disease. However, they were not developed to enable deep phenotyping of abnormalities, to facilitate computational analysis of interpatient phenotypic similarity or to support computational decision support. To address this, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health6 (GA4GH) has developed the Phenopacket schema, which supports the exchange of computable longitudinal case-level phenotypic information for diagnosis of, and research on, all types of disease, including Mendelian and complex genetic diseases, cancers and infectious diseases. A Phenopacket characterizes an individual person or biosample, linking that individual to detailed phenotypic descriptions, genetic information, diagnoses and treatments.</p> <p>The Phenopacket software is available at github.com/phenopackets/.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2022-08-26-Phenopackets-practical-introduction-AdvGen/","title":"GA4GH Phenopackets: A Practical Introduction","text":""},{"location":"publications/2022-08-26-Phenopackets-practical-introduction-AdvGen/#ladewig-ms-jacobsen-jo-wagner-ah-danis-d-kassaby-be-gargano-m-groza-t-baudis-m-steinhaus-r-seelow-d-bechrakis-ne-mungall-cj-schofield-pn-elemento-o-smith-l-mcmurry-ja-munoz-torres-m-haendel-ma-and-robinson-pn","title":"Ladewig MS, Jacobsen JO, Wagner AH, Danis D, Kassaby BE, Gargano M, Groza T, Baudis M, Steinhaus R, Seelow D, Bechrakis NE, Mungall CJ, Schofield PN, Elemento O, Smith L, McMurry JA, Munoz-Torres M, Haendel MA and Robinson PN","text":""},{"location":"publications/2022-08-26-Phenopackets-practical-introduction-AdvGen/#advanced-genetics-2022-2200016-link","title":"Advanced Genetics 2022, 2200016.

The GA4GH Phenopacket Schema is a standard for sharing disease and phenotype information that characterizes an individual person or biosample. The Phenopacket Schema is flexible and can represent clinical data for any kind of human disease including rare disease, complex disease, and cancer. It also allows consortia or databases to apply additional constraints to ensure uniform data collection for specific goals. We present phenopacket-tools, an open-source Java library and command-line application for construction, conversion, and validation of phenopackets. Phenopacket-tools simplifies construction of phenopackets by providing concise builders, programmatic shortcuts, and predefined building blocks (ontology classes) for concepts such as anatomical organs, age of onset, biospecimen type, and clinical modifiers. Phenopacket-tools can be used to validate the syntax and semantics of phenopackets as well as to assess adherence to additional user-defined requirements. The documentation includes examples showing how to use the Java library and the command-line tool to create and validate phenopackets. We demonstrate how to create, convert, and validate phenopackets using the library or the command-line application. Source code, API documentation, comprehensive user guide and a tutorial can be found at github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-tools. The library can be installed from the public Maven Central artifact repository and the application is available as a standalone archive. The phenopacket-tools library helps developers implement and standardize the collection and exchange of phenotypic and other clinical data for use in phenotype-driven genomic diagnostics, translational research, and precision medicine applications.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2024-03-01-Beacon-Tips/","title":"Twelve quick tips for deploying a Beacon","text":""},{"location":"publications/2024-03-01-Beacon-Tips/#lauren-a-fromont-mauricio-moldes-michael-baudis-anthony-j-brookes-arcadi-navarro-and-jordi-rambla","title":"Lauren A Fromont, Mauricio Moldes, Michael Baudis, Anthony J Brookes, Arcadi Navarro and Jordi Rambla","text":""},{"location":"publications/2024-03-01-Beacon-Tips/#plos-comput-biol-2024-mar-1203e1011817","title":"PLoS Comput Biol. 2024 Mar 1;20(3):e1011817.","text":"<ul> <li>doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011817.</li> <li>PMID: 38427629</li> </ul> <p>Introduction: In the age of data-driven biomedical research and clinical practice, the sharing of genomic and clinical data for health research and personalized medicine has become an important contribu- tor to improved diagnosis and treatment.

Genomic alterations in cancer cell lines are widely studied as models for oncogenetic events and are represented in a wide range of primary resources. We have created a comprehensive, curated knowledge resource - cancercelllines.org - with the aim to enable easy access to genomic profiling data in cancer cell lines, curated from a variety of resources and integrating both copy number and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) data. We have gathered over 5,600 copy number profiles as well as SNV annotations for 16,000 cell lines and provide this data with mappings to the GRCh38 reference genome. Both genomic variations and associated curated metadata can be queried through the GA4GH Beacon v2 API and a graphical user interface with extensive data retrieval enabled using GA4GH data schemas under a permissive licensing scheme.</p> <p>Availability and Implementation: Our resource is publicly available on the web at cancercelllines.org.</p>"}]}
